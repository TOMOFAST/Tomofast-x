Input data:
meshgrid_2depth_2prism.txt      - the model grid file.
dummy_dense_surface_data.obs    - dummy surface data only. Data points are dense for visualisation of forward response.
dummy_dh_data.obs               - dummy downhole data only.
dummy_surface_and_dh_data.obs   - dummy downhole and surface data.
dummy_surface_data.obs          - dummy surface data only.

The setup is similar to:

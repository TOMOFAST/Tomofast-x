# Tomofast-x  v.1.2

Geophysical 3D potential field joint and constrained parallel inversion code.  
Authors: Vitaliy Ogarko, Jeremie Giraud, Roland Martin.

Tomofast-x is 3D parallel inversion platform to run single domain or joint inversion (gravity and magnetic data).
It can use local weighting of gradient regularization function, global and local petrophysical constraints (Gaussian mixture model and multiple disjoint bound constraints).
Tomofast-x can run in parallel on laptops and supercomputers, using distributed memory systems.
Tomofast-x supports the parallel wavelet compression of the sensitivity kernel for significant memory reduction and improved performace.

The source code is a companion to the publication detailing Tomofast-x geophysical calculations and examples of utilisation and realistic dataset:

### Compiling and running

To compile the code you need: gcc v.4.9 or more recent, and the MPI library (such as OpenMPI).

The makefile is contained in the root folder and should be used to compile Tomofast-x. Compiling the code is a necessary step to be able to run inversions.  
To compile the code run the make command in the code directory as:  
```shell
make
```

To run the code with your parameter file:
```shell
./tomofastx -j <Parfile path>
```

To run the code in parallel execute:
```shell
mpirun -np <number CPUs> -j <Parfile path>
```

To run unit tests (serial and parallel):
```shell
./runtests.sh
mpirun -np 3 ./runtests.sh
```

### Running the examples

The input data is contained in the folder ``data``.  
The input parameter file (Parfile) which contains all the parameters of the inversion, is stored in the folder: ``parfiles``.  
The output data is stored in the folder ``output``. The full output folder path is specified in the Parfile parameter ``global.outputFolderPath``.


To run the test example:
```shell
./tomofastx -j ./parfiles/Parfile_mansf_slice.txt
```

If the code runs successfully you will see in the end of the screen log the messages "*Writing the full model...*", and "*THE END*".
To visualize the final model, open in Paraview the file ``Paraview/grav_final_model3D_full.vtk`` (or ``Paraview/mag_final_model3D_full.vtk``), located in the output folder.
For details on other output files, see the User Manual in the ``docs`` folder.
